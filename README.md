My case study is based on the multilevel Feedback queue algorithm and it is twisted into two levels i.e.,one working on the basis of Fixed priority preemitive Scheduling and other working on the basis of Round robin scheduling algorithm.For Fixed priority primitive Scheduling algorithm “0” is
the Highest priority and the first queue will processed first then the second queue will be processed on the basis of Round robin algorithm with a time quantum in the multiples of “2”.
